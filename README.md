# life analysis
inspo:
- because I wanted to learn specific things in pandas/matplotlib and didn't want to dig around for another dataset (going down the rabbit hole of kaggle)

what:
- essentially me making my own dataframes and visualizing those
- i guess you could call this a "study of data visualization"?
